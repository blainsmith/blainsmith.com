This word is used throughout the startup and tech worlds and it annoys the shit out of me. Not only does it seem to stroke the egos using it, but it is also being used in completely the wrong context. Both of these definitions indicate no decisions being made on the person being hustled. How does this have anything to do with successfully launching a startup, product, or completing any task that is worth a damn?

**hustle (verb)**

1. force (someone) to move hurriedly or unceremoniously in a specified direction.  
"they hustled him into the back of a horse-drawn wagon"
2. obtain by forceful action or persuasion.  
"the brothers headed to New York to try and hustle a record deal"

> Haste makes waste.

When taking on a job or a task does telling the world at 10pm at night that you are working on it and "hustling" actually help get the work done right? How does rushing to get the job done make it any better? Wouldn't you prefer to take your time and methodically execute on it so its done right the first time?

I work at a startup now and I am proud to say that none of us fuckin' hustle on a daily basis. Under certain conditions there may be a deadline that needs to be met, but that is on a rare occasion. The rest of the time is spend building quality systems that will stand up future demand. Why? Because we didn't fuckin' hustle.

Sometimes I feel sorry for those who feel the need they have to hustle to be successful. Shame on those who preach that as the way to achieve that success. Those who do preach it remind me of religious con men who make their money on spewing falsehoods the masses paying for your books and conferences. They did not hustle. They did it because it was passion that drove them to success. Passion is why they were up late at night building their project. They are successful because they were passionate and believed in their product.

Passion and planning yields success so stop fuckin' hustling and do it right.
