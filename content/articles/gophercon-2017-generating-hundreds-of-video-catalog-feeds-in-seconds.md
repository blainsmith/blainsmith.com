When lightning talks CFPs were announced for GopherCon 2017 I was hesitant. I had
given plenty of [talks before](/articles/tedxalbany-the-master-of-my-fate) and a few [lightning talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz3i3bZB4LK39TdDJrm1lDA), which were to small crowds, but
I've only been writing Go for 8 months, it would be my first GopherCon, and they had
and impressive line up of speakers, so I wasn't sure what I could contribute. That
damn [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) kicked in pretty hard. However, I figured what the hell, and
threw my hat into the ring to see if I would get selected. Low and behold, I did,
and now I had to go through with it and I am very happy I did. Even though I was extremely
overwhelmed with the attention they gave to the lightning talks it also made me feel
included and important enough to contribute.

Thank you [Brian](https://twitter.com/bketelsen), [Erik](https://twitter.com/erikstmartin), and company for GopherCon and [Mark](https://twitter.com/markbates) for organizing the lightning
talks. I'll be sending in a CFP for the main event next year!
