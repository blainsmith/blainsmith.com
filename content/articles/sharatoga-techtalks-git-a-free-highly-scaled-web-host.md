title: 'Sharatoga TechTalks: git a Free, Highly Scaled Web Host'
---

It was fun to give a quick talk to educate people about leveraging [GitHub](http://github.com) as a web host for basic websites at the November [Sharatoga TechTalks](http://sharatogatechtalks.com). From the discussions afterwards it sounded like everyone learned something new which is always a plus. Some even had some [mind blowing](http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mind-blownemotionsshockedmind-blowing.gif) experiences! The [slides from my talk](http://blainsmith.com/sharatoga-techtalks-nov-2014/) are available online and on their own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/blainsmith/sharatoga-techtalks-nov-2014).

Other talks from that night were:
