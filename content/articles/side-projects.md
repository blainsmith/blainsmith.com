title: Side Projects
---

I've been hearing a lot of chatter about [side projects](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sideprojects&src=typd) lately. First was from fellow Glory Lord, [Mubs](https://twitter.com/mubashariqbal), when he gave a talk at [Sharatoga TechTalks](http://sharatogatechtalks.com) in February 2015. He is basically the king of side projects north of Albany, NY as far as I am concerned. So what he had to say was very inspiring.

A few weeks later Twitter started getting more activity about side projects and then one very popular dev's tweet came into my timeline about
his side projects. [Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://twitter.com/antirez) aka "Antirez", the creator of [Redis](http://redis.io), wrote about his
list of [side projects](http://antirez.com/news/86). Yes Redis started as a side project and now look at where it is today. Pretty amazing.

In the spirit of side projects I decided to add a new ["Side Projects"](/projects) page to my site that listed some of the bigger efforts I have completed. There is still a bunch of other projects I have on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/blainsmith), but these are the ones I felt deserved to be featured on my side.
