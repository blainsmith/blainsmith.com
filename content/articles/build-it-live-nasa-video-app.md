Yet another appearance at Sharatoga TechTalks to cover building a NASA video app in 15 minutes with the Odd Networks developer platform. Even though I had a short amount of time I also went over how we built the platform using [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) to move as fast as we could to get an MVP. I have plans to elaborate on this topic and give a more in depth talk at other JavaScript conferences.
