title: I Love My Fear
---

This was sent to me by a very good [friend of mine](http://linkedin.com/in/rachelleboff) and it deserves to be shared. However, the author is unknown, so if anyone knows who it was please let me know so I can credit them.

> What do I fear?  
> I fear stagnation and lack of progress.  
> I fear never reaching my potential and being average.  
> I fear being forgotten... The past... Yesterday's news.  
> I fear giving up and being passed by, going softly into that good night.  
> I fear letting those I love down, letting myself down.  
> I fear settling, giving into the "that's just the way it is" mindset.  
> I fear dying without leaving my mark.  
> I fear not feeling these fears anymore and just floating along.  
> These fears feed me, they nourish my drive.
>
> I love my fear.

This actually gave me chills when I read it. It is so true.
