title: Statamic Minimal Theme
---

This isn't much of an article, but more of an announcement about finishing up a [Statamic](http://statamic.com) Minumal theme inspired by blog network of [http://svbtle.com](http://svbtle.com). I kept it simple by only supporting blog posts and no pages. This follows Svbtle's focus about writing down your thoughts.

Some of Svbtle's sites:

- [http://dcurt.is](http://dcurt.is)
- [http://philosophically.com](http://philosophically.com)
- [http://wayoftheduck.com](http://wayoftheduck.com)

I still need to make it responsive unless someone else wants to tackle that and send me a pull request. Have at it!
