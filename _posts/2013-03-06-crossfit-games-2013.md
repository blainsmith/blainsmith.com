I never thought I would both to register for such a massive event, but considering it was only $20 I figured what the hell. It will definitely be an experience and a humbling one at that to see where I am ranked in comparison to the rest of the world. I have only been doing CrossFit for just over a year now and I have come a long way since day one of not be able to complete 100 wall balls in 20 minutes. Now I can do Fran in just over 7 minutes and Grace just under 4.

A am certainly not the best athlete at [my box](http://games.crossfit.com/affiliate/1765), but I can hang with the best of them at some things. Only time will tell to see how I stack up to the rest of the world. You can follow my progress on my [athlete profile](http://games.crossfit.com/athlete/109544). If you are competing yourself, let me know, I'd love to follow yours.

I will be posting updates for each WOD during The Open so check back from time to time.
