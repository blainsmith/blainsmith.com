title: First Day at Collar Collective
---
<p>Yesterday I was lucky enough to spend the day down at the co-working space offered up by <a href="http://www.agoragames.com/" target="_blank">Agora Games</a>. It has been dubbed <a href="http://www.collarcollective.org/" target="_blank">&#8220;The Collar Collective&#8221;</a> because of its location in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York" target="_blank">Troy, NY</a>, aka &#8220;Collar City&#8221;. Troy&#8217;s mark in history is due to its  shirt, collar, and other textile productions. I was extremely happy to learn about this since where I grew up only 20 minutes away was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">Lowell, MA</a>, which is also very well known for its historic textile industry. It felt like visiting a piece of home. Inside the building the perfect blending of rustic historic brick walls and wood floors with modern desks, video games, and computer equipment.</p>

<p>And to top if off, the best part was the employees of Agora Games. Even though they were grouped in a separate wing of the floor, they still came over to welcome me to the space and spent time to get to know me. It was a great change of pace from working in my home office.</p>

<p>Lunch was spent at Dinosaur BBQ with a brew and 5 guys from the Agora crew talking cars and hiking. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of shop talk, which was refreshing.</p>

<p>I want to thank all the guys (<a href="http://twitter.com/WashUffize" target="_blank">Aaron</a>, Andrew, <a href="http://twitter.com/genexp" target="_blank">Brian</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/clarkefoley" target="_blank">Clarke</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/CzarneckiD" target="_blank">David</a>, Steve, <a href="http://twitter.com/tquackenbush" target="_blank">Tom</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/vitaly_babiy" target="_blank">Vitaly</a>) and any others I didn&#8217;t get to officially meet for offering up not only a sweet physical place to work, but a fun, laid back environment as well.</p>

<p>The only thing that could have made the place better was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbwaiter_(elevator)" target="_blank">dumbwaiter</a> set up near my desk since I was <em>directly</em> sitting 2 floors above a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts!</p>

<p>I will be back!</p>
