title: A New Focus, a New Design, and a New CMS
---
A few weeks ago I just happen to pull up my site (powered by Tumblr) and I noticed I had a shit ton of photos, quotes, and crap completely unrelated to my profession. I wanted my site to represent not only the professional me, but the personal me as well. However, I think I went a little overboard on the personal side. Because of that realization I decided to refocus my website and with that new focus came a new design powered by a new content management system.

With my new focus on writing good articles I need a design that highlighted that content. So what you are looking at is a text only design, with the exception of the occasional picture or two in an article. And as luck would have it this [new wicked awesome CMS, Statamic](http://statamic.com/), launched. All of my content is in flat files and formated in Markdown. How cool is that?! Seriously, what better way to focus on writing than to use a CMS that prides itself on simplicity and focused on content. So I have to give thanks to the two woodsman responsible for this awesome product, [Jack McDade](http://jackmcdade.com/) and [Mubashar Iqbal](http://www.mubashariqbal.com/).

With all that said I hope you enjoy the new blainsmith.com! \m/
