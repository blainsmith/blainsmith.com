title: CrossFit or Strength and Conditioning?
---
Every since starting CrossFit 2+ years ago I have completely engulfed myself with learning as much as I can about fitness, nutrition, gymnastics, olympic weightlifting, power lifting, and everything in between.

The more I learned about what it takes to be a well rounded athlete and to generally be physically fit the more I realized that "CrossFit" is just marketing and branding. Sure the activities you do as part of a CrossFit program span multiple diciplines, but all it needed was to be called something in order for the general public to associate with it and want to sign up.

Kleenex, Kool-aid, Coke, and Q-tips are among the many other brands out there that have been come synonymous with the products they are. These are just brand names for facial tissue, flavored drink mix, soda, and cotton swabs. CrossFit has become one of those brands and they deserve it. They have spent a great deal of energy building that name into the empire it is today.

However, this does not mean that in order to become physically fit you need to sign up at a CrossFit box. You can get the same results by training at a strength and conditioning gym as well. Its just not branded as a "CrossFit" affiliated gym. You will get individualized training and nutritional advice at any strength and conditioning gym to meat your goals.

The programming I follow is posted on The Outlaw Way. Their program is called ["Outlaw Power"](http://theoutlawway.com/category/outlawpower/). All of these movements I do at my CrossFit box, but they can be done at any well-equipped strength and conditioning gym as well. My coaches are open and helpful enough to fine-tune the programming to help me on a daily basis even though I do not need their full attention for the hour I am there. Their gym could be called "Feral Pick Things Up and Put Them Down Really Fast" and I would still go there. However, it did help that they are Feral CrossFit which got my foot in the door in the first place 2 years ago.

However, now that I am 2+ years wiser I would urge you to also consider a strength and conditioning gyms as a possibility if you are deciding to join a gym. At the end of the day it all comes down to how comfortable you feel at the palce you pick and if it meet your goals. And lastly, have fun with it!
