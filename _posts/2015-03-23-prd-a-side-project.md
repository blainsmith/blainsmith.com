I am becoming a regular at speaking at Sharatoga Tech Talks lately. Its a really nice low pressure venue
to not only practice public speaking, but also share what is going on with my local tech community.

This past meetup I shared my current side project that highlights one of my non-tech passions, fitness and
weightlifting. [PRd](http://prdapp.com) has been out for over a year and I am currently rearchitecting it
for the next major release.
