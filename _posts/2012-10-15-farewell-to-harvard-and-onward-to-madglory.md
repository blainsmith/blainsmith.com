title: Farewell to Harvard and Onward to MadGlory
---
Well believe it or not after 7 memorable years working in the [Harvard School of Public Health Information Technology Department](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/it) I have decided to leave. I will be taking up my new post at [MadGlory Interactive](http://madgloryint.com) as Chief Architect. MadGlory is a web software company that creates awesome stuff for the video gaming and entertainment industry. This new direction is bitter sweet, but it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. The guys that are working in the company are some of the [smartest and creative people](http://madgloryint.com/experience) I know. I needed to become apart of their, now our, growing company. 

Over the past years at Harvard I have had the pleasure of working with some really great people throughout the Harvard community. A few noteable friendships are Kevin Wnek who I run [Adjacent Concepts](http://adjacentconcepts.com) with, Tina Haupert who blogs over at [Carrots N' Cake](http://carrotsncake.com), and my boss, Deane Eastwood. Kevin and I actually redesigned his [golf club's website](http://bellevuegolfclub.com) so I will always be in touch with him. 

On top of meeting so many great people I had numerous opportunities to expand my skillset. I entered knowing a few programming languages, but I am leaving knowing a lot more. My writing, communication, and project management skills improved dramatically. I was also able to get down and dirty with server admin work which I never thought I would get into. 

Harvard gave me a lot over my years so I wanted to take this opportunity to thank them very much and wish them the best on all of their future projects. I may be leaving, but I will never be gone.
