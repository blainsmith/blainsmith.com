title: Why? Because I Believe!
---
My wife and I have been on a TED talk kick lately on Netflix and this morning I came across and oldie, but a goodie. **Simon Sinek: How great leaders inspire action**. This got me thinking about [MadGlory](http://twitter.com/madgloryint) and why I wanted to work with them so badly. Their beliefs spoke to me and since I strongly felt the same way I needed to do whatever I could do to join the family.

Every day, since starting in October 2012, my family members do or say something that supports my belief in our company. I say "our" because that's what it is. Its not someone else's, its everyone's. 

We do what we do because we want to make the most out of life and love what we do every day. We do that by being best friends, supporting each other and making sure everyone that works here feels like they are part of a family. We just happen to build websites or "do awesome shit" as [Seth](http://twitter.com/sethlouey) would say.

In Simon's talk he explains why we as consumers trust the companies we do when it comes to buying products or services. I believe that "why" we have at MadGlory is the reason we have been so successful in less than a year from opening our doors.
