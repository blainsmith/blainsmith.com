title: About
---
I thrive on solving problems in the areas of web sites all the way through to mechanical issues with my mustang and motorcycle. It is a thrill to take a step back and bask in the moment of accomplishment. I blame my parents for that.

I am a partner at [MadGlory](http://madglory.com) and [Odd Networks](http://oddnetworks.com). I also co-own [Adjacent Concepts](http://adjacentconcepts.com), a web design and custom web app development shop based in Boston.

I train at [Feral Fitness](http://feralfitness.org) to compete locally at events and get better at [Weightlifting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting). Blacksmithing and welding is also some other of my other hobbies.

P.S.  
I like the Alien movies and anything to do with zombies!
