- title: PRd
  url: http://prdapp.com
  synopsis: Most gym apps sucked for what I needed. All I really needed was simple daily logging with notes and a way for me to track my progress and records specific exercises. So I made PRd to do just that and only that. I have about 50 people using it and I plan to upgrade it soon to be able to scale better and offer a native mobile app.
- title: LeagueBook
  url: http://leaguebook.org
  synopsis: We had a hack weekend at MadGlory so Kirk, Clay, and I made LeagueBook to let League of Legends players sign up and pick their college to see how their school stacks up against the rest of the country. We periodically update it and we have some pretty nice features to get into it in the future.
- title: Wendler 5/3/1 Calculator
  url: http://rblgk.io/wendler-531-calculator/
  repo: https://github.com/blainsmith/wendler-531-calculator
  synopsis: When I start a cycle of Wendler 5/3/1 I found myself constantly firing up a calculator to run through all the percentages for my lifts. It was tedious and annoyting so this calculator made it easy to get an entire cycle calculated all at once.
- title: Max Reps Calculator
  url: http://rblgk.io/max-reps-calculator/
  repo: https://github.com/blainsmith/max-reps-calculator
  synopsis: From time to time I need to know what my 1 rep max or even my 5 rep max is on certain lifts. So I built this calculator to assist with finding those numbers based on a wide variety of formulas which I can pick from.
- title: Gearhead
  repo: https://github.com/blainsmith/gearhead
  synopsis: I wanted to further understand how to build, test, and design a utility library for both the browser and the server. So I picked doing a automotive math library since I didn't see one anywhere. I learned a few tricks from this while teaching myself some engine building math.
- title: ODB Codes API
  url: http://obdcodes.herokuapp.com/
  repo: https://github.com/blainsmith/obdcodes
  synopsis: I thought it would be cool to spin up a free API for looking up ODB codes. It just sits there running quietly on a free Heroku dyno minding its own business.
